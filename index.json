Despite the existence of privacy policies, a significant challenge arises as they are often overlooked or misunderstood by users, hence the need for an automated analysis to provide clearer insights to users and other stakeholders. Unlike previous works, this project pivots towards addressing the gap in privacy policies specific to smart devices which present unique challenges in collection and analysis due to their dispersed nature across various manufacturers and e-commerce platforms.\nThe PrivacyLens framework operates in three core stages; Collection, Analysis, and Publication. Initially, it crawls prominent e-commerce sites for smart IoT devices, extracting metadata and privacy policies, while also utilizing the Wayback Machine to garner historical privacy policies for longitudinal analysis. Following the collection, the framework employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to dissect these policies, aiming to deduce features like overall quality, readability, and ambiguity among others. The final stage sees the publishing of this analyzed data on a dedicated website, updated monthly to provide users, policy authors, and regulators a robust, updated resource to understand and compare privacy practices across a multitude of smart devices. As of the submission, PrivacyLens has successfully amassed and analyzed over 1,200 privacy policies for 7,300 smart devices, presenting a significant stride towards fostering transparency and informed decision-making in the realm of smart device privacy. Through PrivacyLens, stakeholders varying from ordinary consumers to data protection regulators are equipped with a powerful tool to understand and navigate the privacy landscape of IoT devices, marking a crucial step towards creating a more responsible and transparent digital ecosystem.\n","date":1691712000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691712000,"objectID":"b1e4c35be52a2f5c28861dec7a939368","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/project/privacylens/","publishdate":"2023-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/privacylens/","section":"project","summary":"Framework aimed at discovering, collecting, and analyzing privacy policies of smart devices using NLP and ML algorithms, to provide insights to users, policy authors, and regulators.","tags":["Internet of Things","Privacy","Artificial Intelligence","Active"],"title":"PrivacyLens","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sragvi Nidamarti successfully defended his Master\u0026rsquo;s Thesis \u0026lsquo;Addressing Trust Concerns in the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain: A Knowledge Graph Approach\u0026rsquo;.

This change is heavily attributed to factors such as high-quality manufacturing and environmental concerns. However, customers may have concerns regarding the eco-friendliness of the manufacturing process involved and the socio-economic impact (labor law violations) of batteries, possibly due to the newness of the technology involved and a lack of transparency in the process and supply chain. This thesis presents a system to help build trust around this concern. It has a knowledge graph that acts as a base representing standard elements of trust, constructed as an integration of state-of-the-art ontologies in the field. It also includes knowledge about the manufacturing process and the supply chain. With this information, the system uses a mechanism to address the concerns using SPARQL queries that can, among others, label potential trust issues in the manufacturing of electric vehicles. We showcase a use case in which we identify trust issues in certain popular EV manufacturers.\n","date":1690416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690416000,"objectID":"bdc4d8c29fd0494446dca1b4f1d15dfe","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/post/07-27-2023-thesis-defense/","publishdate":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/07-27-2023-thesis-defense/","section":"post","summary":"Sragvi Nidamarti successfully defended his Master\u0026rsquo;s Thesis \u0026lsquo;Addressing Trust Concerns in the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain: A Knowledge Graph Approach\u0026rsquo;.

Smart speakers, doorbells, and TVs are becoming pervasive but raise important privacy concerns. For instance, by collecting audio and video, one could learn private information about us such as our age, emotions, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. To increase trust, there is a need to inform people about potentially sensitive inferences that can be made about them by smart devices and give them a choice to consent to it. We have built a prototype of a framework, using open-source code and AI/ML algorithms, that generates inferences about an individual based on audio (e.g., speech data collected by a smart speaker) and video (e.g., images collected by a smart security camera). The framework also allows the user to select which of these inferences should be \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo;. We have explored different mechanisms to hide those inferences while preserving utility such as: removing specific portions of audio/video that can lead to whether the person might be facing a respiratory disease or modifying the pitch/tone to hide their age and mood.\n","date":1678233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678233600,"objectID":"063ad8efdcfdab348e431343a75c4625","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/post/3-8-2023-umbc-urcad/","publishdate":"2023-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/3-8-2023-umbc-urcad/","section":"post","summary":"Our undergrad team looking at privacy issues on smart homes (Tartela, Luke, Ruhshana, and Josh) will present a poster during UMBC\u0026rsquo;s Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Day (URCAD) 2023.\nAnalyzing Privacy and Utility Tradeoffs in Smart Homes\nTartela Tabassum, Luke Zimmermann, Ruhshana Bobojonova, Joshua Cheeks\n","tags":null,"title":"Poster accepted for presentation at UMBC's URCAD 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":["Maksim E.

It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem.

It also generates guarded expressions that save on evaluation cost by grouping policies and exploit database indices to cut on read cost.

SemIoTic uses a meta-model, based on the popular SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions, to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices' world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts (i.e., users and spaces and their observable attributes).

SemIoTic uses a metamodel based on the popular SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices' world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts (i.e., observable attributes of users and spaces). It supports a language where users can express their action requirements (i.e., requests for sensor data, commands for actuators, and privacy preferences) in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts. We present an ontology-based algorithmic approach to translate user-defined actions into sensor/actuators commands. Finally, our end-to-end approach includes a cross-layer solution to provide interoperability with diverse IoT devices and their data exchange protocols.\nSeveral instances of SemIoTic have been deployed and used in IoT spaces. At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19. Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple regions of the ship.\nUseful links and references  SemIoTic is developed as part of the TIPPERS (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.

To provide such services, IoT systems need to handle data captured from multiple devices/sensors, and translation of data processing policies agreed by users (high-level) into commands for devices (device-level). The underlying assumption is that users trust IoT systems in honoring their policies. However, this trust assumption is incorrectly positioned since IoT systems may not be honest or may fall victim to cyberattacks. We address such concerns by providing mechanisms to help in ensuring trust and accountability at the time of translating a contract (agreed and signed policies). The objective of the proposed scheme is two fold, (1) translation of contracts from a high-level to device-level, (2) attestation of the translation. We have implemented the proposed scheme for contract translation and attestation of translation as a module and integrated it with the TIPPERS system (our IoT testbed under development). The results of our experiments highlight the feasibility of our proposed schemes.","tags":["Internet of Things","Data Management","Privacy"],"title":"Trustworthy Privacy Policy Translation in Untrusted IoT Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eun-Jeong Shin","Roberto Yus","Sharad Mehrotra","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"b0871d5b62139b0eee634fc6232fa0c8","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/publication/buildsys-2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/buildsys-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Current buildings rely on predefined rules to control the temperature in rooms disregarding their residents’ thermal comfort. Multiple approaches have been presented in the literature to tackle this issue (e.g., by enabling occupants to express their feedback using their mobile devices). In general setting, to reach consensus among group members, we apply decision making methods (e.g., majority, mean, trimmed mean, and median) to aggregate the diverse expected comfort levels of the inhabitants. However, such methods might be unfair to some participants. In this paper, we present the first study of the issue of fairness in participatory thermal comfort control. Inspired by the traditional definitions in scheduling, we introduce a definition of fairness that is suitably adapted to the particularities of our scenario. We then present our design of an aggregation method that ensures fairness. Finally, we show how our algorithm behaves compared with traditional aggregation methods in diverse simulated scenarios.","tags":["Internet of Things","Data Management","Fairness"],"title":"Exploring fairness in participatory thermal comfort control in smart buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"62f29b617f905dd761b82d25a24bf276","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/members/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/members/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
