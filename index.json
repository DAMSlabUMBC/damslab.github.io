Smart space datasets are critical to design, deploy and evaluate robust systems and applications to ensure cost-effective operation and safety/comfort/convenience of the space occupants. Often, real-world data is difficult to obtain due to the lack of fine-grained sensing; privacy/security concerns prevent the release and sharing of individual and spatial data. SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that can create a digital representation (twin) of a smart space and its activities. SmartSPEC uses a semantic model and ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes in a sensorized space, and applies an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc). To evaluate the realism of the data generated by SmartSPEC, we develop a structured methodology and metrics to assess various aspects of smart space datasets, including trajectories of people and occupancy of spaces. Our experimental study looks at two real-world settings/datasets: an instrumented smart campus building and a city-wide GPS dataset. Our results show that the trajectories produced by SmartSPEC are 1.4x to 4.4x more realistic than the best synthetic data baseline when compared to real-world data, depending on the scenario and configuration.\n","date":1644796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644796800,"objectID":"077e6d08e9dbe1311b967570f974662a","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/post/2-14-2022-percom-smartspec/","publishdate":"2022-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2-14-2022-percom-smartspec/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper on the generation of realistic synthetic IoT datasets has been accepted at PerCom 2022.

WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points (APs), each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning tasks - frst, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. LOCATER uses a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for coarse localization and a probabilistic method to achieve fner localization. The paper shows that LOCATER can achieve signifcantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fne levels.","tags":["Data Management","Internet of Things"],"title":"LOCATER: Cleaning WiFi Connectivity Datasets for Semantic Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael August","Christopher Davison","Mamadou H.

Given a query, Sieve exploits its context to filter the policies that need to be checked. It also generates guarded expressions that save on evaluation cost by grouping policies and exploit database indices to cut on read cost. Our experimental results demonstrate that existing DBMSs can utilize Sieve to significantly reduce query-time policy evaluation cost. Using Sieve DBMSs can support real-time access control in applications such as emerging smart environments.","tags":["Data Management","Privacy"],"title":"Sieve: A Middleware Approach to Scalable Access Control for Database Management Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peeyush Gupta","Michael J.

At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19. Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple regions of the ship.\nUseful links and references  SemIoTic is developed as part of the TIPPERS (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.

To provide such services, IoT systems need to handle data captured from multiple devices/sensors, and translation of data processing policies agreed by users (high-level) into commands for devices (device-level). The underlying assumption is that users trust IoT systems in honoring their policies. However, this trust assumption is incorrectly positioned since IoT systems may not be honest or may fall victim to cyberattacks. We address such concerns by providing mechanisms to help in ensuring trust and accountability at the time of translating a contract (agreed and signed policies). The objective of the proposed scheme is two fold, (1) translation of contracts from a high-level to device-level, (2) attestation of the translation. We have implemented the proposed scheme for contract translation and attestation of translation as a module and integrated it with the TIPPERS system (our IoT testbed under development). The results of our experiments highlight the feasibility of our proposed schemes.","tags":["Internet of Things","Data Management","Privacy"],"title":"Trustworthy Privacy Policy Translation in Untrusted IoT Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eun-Jeong Shin","Roberto Yus","Sharad Mehrotra","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"b0871d5b62139b0eee634fc6232fa0c8","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/publication/buildsys-2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/buildsys-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Current buildings rely on predefined rules to control the temperature in rooms disregarding their residents’ thermal comfort. Multiple approaches have been presented in the literature to tackle this issue (e.g., by enabling occupants to express their feedback using their mobile devices). In general setting, to reach consensus among group members, we apply decision making methods (e.g., majority, mean, trimmed mean, and median) to aggregate the diverse expected comfort levels of the inhabitants. However, such methods might be unfair to some participants. In this paper, we present the first study of the issue of fairness in participatory thermal comfort control. Inspired by the traditional definitions in scheduling, we introduce a definition of fairness that is suitably adapted to the particularities of our scenario. We then present our design of an aggregation method that ensures fairness. Finally, we show how our algorithm behaves compared with traditional aggregation methods in diverse simulated scenarios.","tags":["Internet of Things","Data Management","Fairness"],"title":"Exploring fairness in participatory thermal comfort control in smart buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"62f29b617f905dd761b82d25a24bf276","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/members/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/members/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://damslabumbc.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
